# Gulp Static Website Starter ðŸ¥¤

My personal starter template for static website development with `Gulp`.

## How to build it?

Install `node_modules` and start development mode, which uses `BrowserSync`.

```
npm i && gulp serve
```

(Optional) Finally build and test it locally.

```
gulp build && npx serve _build
```
