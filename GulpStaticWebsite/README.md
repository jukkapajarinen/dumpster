# Gulp Static Website Starter ðŸ¥¤

My personal starter template for static website development with `Gulp`.

## How to use it?

Install `node_modules`.

```
npm i
```

Start development mode, which uses `BrowserSync`.

```
gulp serve
```

(Optional) Finally build and test it locally.

```
gulp build && npx serve _build
```
